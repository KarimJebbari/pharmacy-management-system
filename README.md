# Pharmacy Management System

A pharmacy management system developed with Laravel, MySQL, Bootstrap, CSS, and a bit of AJAX. 
The system allows pharmacists to manage medications, monitor stock and expiration, and handle customer orders efficiently.


## Key Features

- Pharmacist login page to manage medications.
- Real-time display of medications in the customer purchase page.
- Customers can send purchase requests that appear directly for the pharmacist.
- Alerts for medications nearing expiration.
- Ability to create awareness articles for customers about diseases and proper medications.
- Automated email requests to suppliers when medication stock runs out.

### Pharmacist Dashboard

This is the first page that appears after the pharmacist logs in.  
It provides a complete overview of the medications previously added by the pharmacist and allows the following actions:

- View the list of all medications.
- Edit or delete any medication.
- See alerts for medications that are expiring soon (within 30 days or less).
- Use the search bar to quickly find medications by name or price.
